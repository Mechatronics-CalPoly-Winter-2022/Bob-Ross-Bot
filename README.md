# Bob Ross Bot

Our term project is a Bob Ross Bot. Much like the real Bob Ross, this robot
will take you on a journey through guided painting lessons, supplemented by
(ai-generated) verbal instructions to help you feel like you're talking to 
the real Bob Ross.

This robot will have a motor that rotates an arm across a piece of paper, a
motor that will rotate a screw which in turn linearly translates a block 
holding a pen across said arm, and will use a solenoid that brings a pen 
(or other writing utensil) to the medium it is drawing on. 

Here is a small schematic that shows what the final result should look like:
